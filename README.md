# PentestLifeHacks_WSL2
 Automate Tasks for you, So that you can focus on ROOTING HTB

# Installation

Download the latest release from https://github.com/HackedOS/PentestLifeHacks_WSL2/releases and extract it
No need to install you can just invoke it by doing `./Stabilize_Shell_pyX.exe`
But i would suggest Adding it to Path so that you can use from anywhere in the shell

# Usage

Invoke the EXE by doing `./Stabilize_Shell_pyX.exe` or just `Stabilize_Shell_pyX.exe` if you have it in PATH
Then focus your Netcat Rev shell terminal and do `CTRL + r` and MAGIC HAPPENS
